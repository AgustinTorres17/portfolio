    "summaryEN": "I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the Faculty of Engineering - UDELAR looking for my first job opportunity. During my time at the university, I have taken several subjects such as Computer Architecture and Networks, Operating Systems, Programming 1, 2, 3 and 4, Programming Workshop, among others. In these subjects I have learned concepts such as Object Oriented Programming, Web Services and Full-Stack Development. I have also taken English courses from Cambridge, among them the most notable and advanced is the FCE (First Certificate in English). I have also carried out several personal projects that have involved the use of current technologies. These projects have covered a wide range of areas, including React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Java, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL. Through these experiences, I have acquired practical skills and solid knowledge in the use of modern technologies and I am eager to apply them in a professional environment."
